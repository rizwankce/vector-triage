Title: Add E2E validation workflow and runbook
Status: done
Priority: P2
Depends_On: WP-013,WP-016
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Provide repeatable end-to-end verification against a test repository.

Scope_In:
- Document E2E scenario with issues and pull requests.
- Add manual/scheduled workflow to run E2E checks.
- Capture expected comment outcomes for duplicate/similar/no-match cases.
- Add rollback guidance for failed E2E runs.

Scope_Out:
- Production auto-remediation logic.

Files_To_Touch:
- docs/e2e-runbook.txt
- .github/workflows/e2e.yml
- README.md

Implementation_Steps:
1. Define deterministic test data and expected outputs.
2. Add E2E workflow scaffold and secrets/config expectations.
3. Write runbook for setup, run, verify, and cleanup.
4. Add checklist for pass/fail criteria.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] E2E runbook can be followed without tribal knowledge.
- [x] Workflow captures artifacts/logs for triage outcomes.
- [x] Duplicate and similar scenarios are both validated.
- [x] Cleanup steps are documented.

Validation:
- Command: manual run of `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`
- Expected: workflow completes and expected triage comments appear.

Notes:
- Keep this isolated from main CI to avoid flaky gate failures.
