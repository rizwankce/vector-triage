Title: Implement RRF fusion and display similarity model
Status: done
Priority: P0
Depends_On: WP-002,WP-003
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Combine vector and FTS results into final ranked triage output.

Scope_In:
- Implement RRF ordering with constant `k=60`.
- Compute `displaySimilarity = max(vecScore, ftsScore)`.
- Apply similarity and duplicate thresholds.
- Truncate to max-results after filtering.

Scope_Out:
- Markdown rendering and GitHub comment I/O.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/store/rrf.go
- internal/store/search.go
- internal/store/search_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Create fused result model with per-source and display scores.
2. Implement RRF accumulation by rank positions.
3. Apply filter, duplicate flag, and max-results limits.
4. Add deterministic tests with known ranked lists.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Final ordering is by RRF score.
- [x] User-facing percentage comes from display similarity.
- [x] Threshold behavior matches spec defaults.
- [x] Tests cover one-list and two-list overlap cases.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/store/... -run 'RRF|Fuse'`
- Expected: fusion tests pass with stable ordering.

Notes:
- Keep this logic pure for easy unit testing.
