Title: Implement triage comment create/update/delete manager
Status: done
Priority: P0
Depends_On: WP-007
Owner: codex
Estimate: 90m

Goal:
- Ensure idempotent triage comments on issues and pull requests.

Scope_In:
- Locate existing bot comment via hidden marker.
- Create new comment when no marker exists.
- Update existing comment when content changes.
- Delete stale comment when new match set is empty.

Scope_Out:
- Markdown generation and ranking logic.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/github/comment.go
- internal/github/client.go
- internal/github/client_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Implement marker-based comment discovery helper.
2. Add upsert behavior: create vs update.
3. Add delete behavior for empty-result transitions.
4. Add tests for each branch of behavior.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Exactly one bot triage comment exists per item over time.
- [x] Existing marker comment gets updated, not duplicated.
- [x] Old triage comment is deleted when matches disappear.
- [x] Comment manager tests pass.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/github/... -run Comment`
- Expected: create/update/delete behavior validated.

Notes:
- Marker must always be first line of generated comment body.
