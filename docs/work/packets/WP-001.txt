Title: Scaffold store schema and migrations
Status: done
Priority: P0
Depends_On: none
Owner: codex
Estimate: 90m

Goal:
- Implement SQLite schema creation and migration version tracking.

Scope_In:
- Create `items`, `items_fts`, `items_vec`, and `schema_version`.
- Add migration runner with ordered version application.
- Add tests for first-run and migration behavior.

Scope_Out:
- Search, embedding, and GitHub comment posting.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/store/migrations.go
- internal/store/store.go
- internal/store/store_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Add schema SQL and migration version constants.
2. Implement startup migration runner and version checks.
3. Add tests for empty DB init and sequential migration apply.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Fresh DB creates all required tables/indexes/triggers.
- [x] Existing DB migrates to latest schema version without data loss.
- [x] Tests pass for schema init and migration flow.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/store/...`
- Expected: tests pass with no migration regressions.

Notes:
- Keep schema statements idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`) where possible.
