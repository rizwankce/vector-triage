Title: Implement GitHub Models embedder with retries and truncation
Status: done
Priority: P0
Depends_On: none
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Add production embedder implementation using GitHub Models API.

Scope_In:
- Implement `Embedder` interface.
- HTTP client with 30s timeout.
- Retry policy with `Retry-After` and exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s).
- Input truncation to approx 30000 chars.

Scope_Out:
- Search, ranking, and GitHub comment logic.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/embed/embedder.go
- internal/embed/github_models.go
- internal/embed/mock.go
- internal/embed/github_models_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Implement request/response types and auth header handling.
2. Add retry/backoff and non-2xx error handling.
3. Add text truncation helper.
4. Add tests with mocked HTTP server for retries and failures.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Embedder returns 1536-dimension vectors on success.
- [x] Retries honor retry headers/backoff and stop after max attempts.
- [x] Truncation is applied before request send.
- [x] Embedder tests pass.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/embed/...`
- Expected: tests pass for success, retry, and failure paths.

Notes:
- Keep HTTP behavior observable via small test hooks.
