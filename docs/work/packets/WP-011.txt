Title: Implement CLI entrypoint, config parsing, and non-fatal error policy
Status: todo
Priority: P1
Depends_On: WP-010
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Create runnable binary entrypoint used by the GitHub Action.

Scope_In:
- Parse required GitHub env vars and action input env vars.
- Initialize state manager, store, embedder, and engine.
- Execute pull -> handle -> push flow.
- Emit warning annotations and exit 0 for recoverable failures.

Scope_Out:
- Composite action YAML and release CI.

Files_To_Touch:
- cmd/triage/main.go
- internal/engine/engine.go
- README.md

Implementation_Steps:
1. Add config loader with sane defaults and bounds checks.
2. Wire up startup dependencies and execution flow.
3. Apply non-fatal error handling and warning log format.
4. Add focused tests for config parsing and error policy.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [ ] Binary runs with only required GitHub env vars and defaults.
- [ ] Recoverable failures log `::warning::` and exit 0.
- [ ] Panic path exits non-zero.
- [ ] CLI tests pass.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./cmd/triage/...`
- Expected: config and lifecycle tests pass.

Notes:
- Keep config parsing strict enough to catch invalid thresholds.
