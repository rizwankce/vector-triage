Title: Implement FTS search, query builder, and BM25 normalization
Status: todo
Priority: P0
Depends_On: WP-001
Owner: codex
Estimate: 90m

Goal:
- Add full-text retrieval to complement vector search.

Scope_In:
- Build FTS5 query generator from natural text.
- Execute FTS search joined with items metadata.
- Normalize BM25 to ftsScore in [0,1].
- Exclude current item ID in SQL.

Scope_Out:
- Fusion ranking and duplicate thresholding.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/store/fts.go
- internal/store/search.go
- internal/store/search_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Implement `buildFTS5Query` with token cleanup and escaping.
2. Add FTS query execution returning metadata + normalized score.
3. Add exclusion clause for current item ID.
4. Add tests for query building and score normalization.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [ ] FTS query builder handles special characters safely.
- [ ] BM25 normalization matches spec formula.
- [ ] Current item is filtered out from FTS results.
- [ ] Tests cover empty and noisy input queries.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/store/... -run FTS`
- Expected: FTS unit tests pass.

Notes:
- Keep normalization monotonic and query-independent.
