Title: Implement composite action and release workflow with checksums
Status: todo
Priority: P1
Depends_On: WP-011
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Ship a consumable action that downloads a trusted prebuilt binary.

Scope_In:
- Create `action.yml` composite action.
- Download binary from immutable tag.
- Download and verify `.sha256` file before execution.
- Add release workflow to publish binary and checksum assets.

Scope_Out:
- Runtime engine behavior and search quality.

Files_To_Touch:
- action.yml
- .github/workflows/release.yml
- README.md

Implementation_Steps:
1. Add composite action steps with strict shell flags.
2. Add checksum verification step.
3. Add release workflow build + checksum generation + asset upload.
4. Document release/tag process.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [ ] Action runs binary only after checksum verification passes.
- [ ] Release workflow publishes both binary and checksum.
- [ ] Action inputs map to correct `INPUT_*` env vars.
- [ ] Action lint/validation passes.

Validation:
- Command: `act -W .github/workflows/release.yml -n` or CI dry run
- Expected: workflow parses and assets list includes checksum file.

Notes:
- Prefer immutable version tag references in action default config.
