Title: Finalize README, troubleshooting, and performance notes
Status: done
Priority: P2
Depends_On: WP-011,WP-013
Owner: codex
Estimate: 90m

Goal:
- Ship operator-facing documentation for setup, behavior, and debugging.

Scope_In:
- Quick start workflow snippet and permissions.
- Configuration reference and defaults.
- Troubleshooting guide for common failures.
- Performance target notes and tuning guidance.

Scope_Out:
- Feature implementation work.

Files_To_Touch:
- README.md
- docs/troubleshooting.txt
- docs/perf-notes.txt

Implementation_Steps:
1. Document install and first-run behavior.
2. Add config table and environment mapping.
3. Add troubleshooting sections for API, state branch, and sqlite errors.
4. Add runtime budget notes and expected timing breakdown.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] New user can configure action using docs only.
- [x] Common failure modes have concrete remediation steps.
- [x] Performance expectations are explicit and realistic.
- [x] Docs are consistent with current spec and code.

Validation:
- Command: manual docs review against `docs/spec.md`
- Expected: no contradictions across setup, behavior, and defaults.

Notes:
- Keep examples copy-paste ready.
