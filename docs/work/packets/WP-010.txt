Title: Implement engine orchestration flow
Status: done
Priority: P0
Depends_On: WP-004,WP-005,WP-006,WP-008,WP-009
Owner: codex
Estimate: 150m

Goal:
- Wire all components into the canonical triage flow.

Scope_In:
- Ingest event content.
- Embed and run vector + FTS searches.
- Exclude self and fuse results.
- Upsert store state.
- Upsert/delete triage comment.

Scope_Out:
- CLI env parsing and action packaging.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/engine/engine.go
- internal/engine/engine_test.go
- internal/store/store.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Define engine dependencies and constructor.
2. Implement `Handle` sequence with non-fatal error returns upward.
3. Ensure self-ID is passed into both search paths.
4. Add integration-style engine tests with mocks.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Engine flow follows spec order and handles no-match case silently.
- [x] Self-match is excluded for edited/synchronize events.
- [x] Comment is created/updated/deleted correctly based on fused output.
- [x] Engine tests pass.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/engine/...`
- Expected: orchestrator tests pass for issue and PR flows.

Notes:
- Keep side effects behind interfaces to simplify testing.
