Title: Apply pull_request_target security hardening
Status: todo
Priority: P1
Depends_On: WP-013
Owner: codex
Estimate: 90m

Goal:
- Enforce secure behavior when running with base-repo write token.

Scope_In:
- Verify workflow uses `pull_request_target`.
- Ensure no PR branch checkout in action flow.
- Audit shell command usage for untrusted input interpolation.
- Add explicit security checks and docs for forbidden patterns.

Scope_Out:
- Feature additions unrelated to security model.

Files_To_Touch:
- action.yml
- cmd/triage/main.go
- internal/github/event.go
- README.md

Implementation_Steps:
1. Confirm event triggers and permissions are minimal.
2. Audit for `actions/checkout` of PR code and remove if present.
3. Ensure PR content is never executed as shell/template input.
4. Document secure operation and constraints.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [ ] No path executes code from forked PR content.
- [ ] Workflow and docs explicitly state forbidden behaviors.
- [ ] Security assertions are reflected in tests/docs.
- [ ] Security review checklist is complete.

Validation:
- Command: `rg -n \"actions/checkout|pull_request_target|eval|bash -c\" .`
- Expected: no unsafe checkout/eval patterns in action path.

Notes:
- Treat title/body/diff as untrusted text only.
