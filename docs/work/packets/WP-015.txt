Title: Add unit tests across all packages
Status: done
Priority: P1
Depends_On: WP-001..WP-012
Owner: codex
Estimate: 180m

Goal:
- Reach broad unit-level coverage for core project behavior.

Scope_In:
- Store schema/search/fusion tests.
- Embedder retry/truncation tests.
- Ingest content-shape tests.
- Formatter output tests.
- Engine workflow tests with mocks.

Scope_Out:
- Real sqlite-vec integration tests and live GitHub E2E.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/store/*_test.go
- internal/embed/*_test.go
- internal/ingest/*_test.go
- internal/respond/*_test.go
- internal/engine/*_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Add missing tests package by package.
2. Add deterministic fixtures for scored outputs.
3. Cover error paths and no-op conditions.
4. Ensure tests run fast in CI.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Critical paths and edge cases have test coverage.
- [x] Self-match exclusion has direct tests.
- [x] No-match formatter and comment deletion transitions are covered.
- [x] Unit test suite passes reliably.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./...`
- Expected: all unit tests pass.

Notes:
- Prefer table-driven tests for query/format logic.
