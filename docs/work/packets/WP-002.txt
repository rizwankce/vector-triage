Title: Implement sqlite-vec loading and two-step vector search
Status: done
Priority: P0
Depends_On: WP-001
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Add reliable vector search over sqlite-vec with self-match exclusion.

Scope_In:
- Load sqlite-vec extension/bindings at store startup.
- Implement two-step vector query pattern (no JOIN with vec table).
- Convert distance to clamped vecScore in [0,1].
- Exclude current item ID during retrieval.

Scope_Out:
- FTS retrieval and fusion ranking logic.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/store/store.go
- internal/store/search.go
- internal/store/search_test.go
- go.mod

Implementation_Steps:
1. Initialize sqlite-vec support during DB setup.
2. Add vector query API returning scored hits with metadata lookup step.
3. Add self-match filter and clamped score conversion.
4. Add tests for happy path and self-match exclusion.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [x] Vector search uses two-step pattern and avoids JOIN hangs.
- [x] Returned vecScore is always clamped to [0,1].
- [x] Current item is never returned as a match.
- [x] Store tests pass.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/store/...`
- Expected: vector search tests pass, including self-exclusion case.

Notes:
- Keep the query limited to `limit*3` candidates before metadata filtering.
