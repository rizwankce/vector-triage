Title: Implement GitHub event parsing and API client wrappers
Status: todo
Priority: P0
Depends_On: none
Owner: codex
Estimate: 120m

Goal:
- Normalize webhook payloads and GitHub API calls behind internal interfaces.

Scope_In:
- Parse `issues` and `pull_request_target` event payloads.
- Build internal `Event` model fields (title/body/files/diff metadata).
- Create client wrappers for issues, pulls, comments, and files/diff fetch.
- Add error wrapping for non-fatal logging upstream.

Scope_Out:
- Orphan branch state persistence and engine orchestration.

Files_To_Touch:
- internal/github/event.go
- internal/github/client.go
- internal/github/client_test.go

Implementation_Steps:
1. Implement payload parsing functions from event file path.
2. Add go-github wrapper methods used by engine and state manager.
3. Add test fixtures for issue and PR payloads.
4. Add tests for parsing and API wrapper behavior.

Acceptance_Criteria:
- [ ] Issue and PR events map correctly into internal `Event`.
- [ ] Client wrappers hide go-github details from callers.
- [ ] Errors include enough context for warning logs.
- [ ] Parsing tests pass with representative payload fixtures.

Validation:
- Command: `go test ./internal/github/... -run 'Event|Client'`
- Expected: parser/client wrapper tests pass.

Notes:
- Keep wrappers minimal and focused on bot requirements.
